# Tkinter Calculator

The **Tkinter Calculator** is a desktop-based graphical calculator application developed using **Python’s Tkinter library**. It demonstrates how to build interactive GUI applications in Python while handling user input and events effectively. This project is especially suitable for beginners who want hands-on experience with GUI programming.

## Project Overview

This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations through a clean and intuitive graphical interface. All inputs are provided using on-screen buttons, and results are displayed instantly in the input field.

## Features

* Simple and intuitive user interface
* Supports basic arithmetic operations:

  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Division
* Clear (`C`) button to reset input
* Error handling for invalid operations (such as division by zero)
* Responsive button layout using the grid system

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3** – Core programming language
* **Tkinter** – Built-in Python library for GUI development

## Application Structure

* **Entry Widget**: Displays user input and calculation results
* **Button Widgets**: Used for numbers, operators, and actions
* **Grid Layout Manager**: Organizes buttons in a calculator-style layout
* **Event Handling Functions**: Process button clicks and perform calculations

## How to Run the Project

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## Learning Objectives

* Understanding Tkinter widgets and layout management
* Handling user events and button commands
* Managing application state in GUI programs
* Building confidence in Python GUI development

## Future Enhancements

* Add scientific calculator functions
* Improve UI with colors and themes
* Keyboard input support

## Conclusion

This Tkinter Calculator is a great starting point for learning GUI development in Python and can be extended into more advanced applications with additional features.
